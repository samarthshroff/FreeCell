## FreeCell Game – Key Features

- **Interactive FreeCell Solitaire:** Playable version of the classic FreeCell game with drag-and-drop controls.
- **Python & Pygame:** Built using the `pygame` library for window management, graphics rendering, and event handling.
- **Splash Screen:** Shows a custom splash screen on startup for a polished look.
- **Mouse-Driven Card Movement:** Click and drag cards between free cells, home cells, and cascade piles using intuitive mouse controls.
- **Rule-Based Card Placement:** Enforces FreeCell rules for valid card moves (rank/suit checks, legal placements).
- **Dynamic UI Layout:** Board positions for free cells, home cells, and cascades are generated programmatically.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Modular code with clear classes for cards, game logic, and UI rendering.
- **Custom Card Graphics:** Loads and displays PNG card images dynamically.
- **Enumerations & Dataclasses:** Uses Python `enum` and `dataclass` for clean card and move representations.

## Python Techniques Highlighted
